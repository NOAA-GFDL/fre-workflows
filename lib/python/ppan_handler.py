    ''' major differences from inherited SLURMHandler class:
    1) class method for submit() is defined- it has enough flexibility to
    allow us to parse the job script the way we want.
    2) SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL set to None- this is to prevent
    cylc/flow/job_runner_mgr.py from trying to use it in lieu of the submit()
    class method.

    of slightly less note, methods test_import and test_tool_ops_import are
    for assessing import functionality via pytest, in the tests/dir

        """Submit a job.

        Submit a job and return an instance of the Popen object for the
        submission. This handler inherits from SLURMHandler, and is
        catered to GFDL's PP/AN compute resource.

        SLURMHandler has no real submit command- just SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL.
        this class member is set to None and a submit method defined
        instead. as the SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL approach is locked up within
        the cylc code base.

        when job_runner_mgr._jobs_submit_impl finds PPANHandler.submit()
        via hasattr() or getattr(), it will be used. if it were not, it
        would default to using SUBMIT_CMD_TMPL to form a shell command,
        which is then issued via procopen in cylc/flow/cylc_subproc.py.

        You must pass "env=submit_opts.get('env')" to Popen - see
        :py:mod:`cylc.flow.job_runner_handlers.background`
        for an example.
